PPI Sample Applications
-----------------------

cgi.pl - Syntax Highlighting CGI Interface

This is a simple cgi application that provides an interface over PPI,
with the purpose of viewing 'prettied' perl code.

To Install

You should have already installed PPI.

Also ensure that you have the File::Find::Rule module installed.

Next, you will need to get and install AppLib, a small semi-private librayry
for rapidly building web applications, used to create the interface.

It is available http://ali.as/packages/ and should install like a regular
CPAN package.

Finally, copy cgi.pl and html folders to somewhere in CGI.
