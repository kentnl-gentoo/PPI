	- Removing more unneeded dependencies
	- Added native Storable support

	Details:

0.996 Fri Jul  8 2005
	General:
	- RELEASE CANDIDATE 2
	- Clearing all remaining RT bugs
	- Removing and inlining dependencies

	Details:
	- Resolved PDOM bug CPAN #13454 ( while ( $s = $s->sprevious_sibling ) infinite loops )

	- Changes separated into General and Details from here on
	- Complete re-organisation of the quote-like token classes.
	  Any and all code that works with quotes will be broken.
	- Gave up on the old PPI::Query code and wrote a complete new and
	  much thinner implementation based roughly on the API of
	  File::Find::Rule.
	  PPI::Find uses the &wanted function (which also has a slightly
	  different API to the old one) but has the ->in style search methods.
	  It should be relatively easy for someone to write PPI::Find::Rule

0.814 Sat Jun 26 2004
	- Added the PPI tester, a desktop-based interactive debugger, which
