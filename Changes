0.814 Sat Jun 26 2004
	- Added the PPI tester, a desktop-based interactive debugger, which
	  should greatly accelerate finding and fixing both ::Tokenizer

	  distribution though, as it has a dependency on wxPerl.

	  premature end of tokenizer by adding it in a comment at
	  the end of the file.

	- Statement and Structure resolution preliminarily work.
	  Some basic types of statements and structures are identified.
