NAME
    PPI - Parse and manipulate Perl code non-destructively, without using
    perl itself

DESCRIPTION
    This is PPI, originally short for Parse::Perl::Isolated, a package for
    parsing and manipulating Perl documents.

    For more information, see the PPI Manual

    The PPI itself provides the primary mechanism for loading the PPI
    library, as the full library contains over 50 classes.

SUPPORT
    Although this is pre-beta, what code is there should actually work. So
    if you find any bugs, they should be submitted via the CPAN bug tracker,
    located at

    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=PPI>

    For other issues, or commercial enhancement or support, contact the
    author.. In particular, if you want to make a CPAN or private module
    that uses PPI, it would be best to stay in direct contact with the
    author until PPI goes beta.
